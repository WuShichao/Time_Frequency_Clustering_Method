TIME FREQUENCY CLUSTERING METHOD FOR ADVANCED LIGO 
UN-MODELLED BURST GRB SEARCHES

The time-frequency (T-F) clustering method has been applied to X-Pipeline, an analysis package for autonomous GW burst searches. 
This method has been tested on a sample of previously analysed data from the first Advance LIGO’s observing run (O1) with Swift-Fermi burst searches.
The re-analysis has been applied to 7 out of the 23 analysable GRBs when both Hanford and Livingston detector were operating.

Accretion disk instability (ADI) signals were first used in GRB searches in O1 for longer signals. In time-frequency maps, ADIs get broken up by artifacts, like power-lines (60Hz) and violin modes(500Hz) which interfere with the “next nearest neighbour” clustering criteria of X-Pipeline.  To reconnect the broken bits and fully reconstruct the signal a time-frequency window can be built.
 
The T-F method involves exclusively the post-processing part of X-Pipeline. The codes are run using condor, which distributes the computational work in the cluster nodes. The procedure consists of two main steps: clustering and merging. Then a web page is created containing all the results.
The signal is recovered by changing the clustering window size for a series of different time and frequency shifts.
The clustering has been applied to raw triggers, both injections and off-sources, for ten different window sizes. Then the merging has been applied to the triggers, completing the reconstruction of the waveform. 

The clustering window study has been carried out considering the increase in sensitivity generated by the different window sizes. For physical waveforms this increase is given by the ratio of the distance for the clustered values against the un-clustered ones, while for sine-Gaussian waveforms (SGC) it’s the opposite ratio. The 50% confidence level upper limit on the signal amplitude (50% UL) has been used as injection scale for the for physical ADIs waveforms, while the root-sum-squared (hrss) amplitude at 50% {Hz^-1/2} has been used for the SGC waveforms.
For physical waveforms the distance was given by the inverse of the scale multiplied by an integer. For ADI-A, ADI-C, ADI-D, ADI-E and BNS waveform the integer multiplied has to be 10, but for ADI-B and NSBH is 20. For SGC waveforms the distance is simply given by the inverse of the real part of the hrss 50% scale. 
The sensitivity increment has been plotted against the clustering window used, as shown in Figure x. The plot shows an increase in sensitivity proportional to increasing dimension of clustering windows. The Pipeline’s sensitivity reaches a maximum for the window size 15 seconds – 15 Hertz and then shows a ‘plateaux’ like behaviour for wider windows.  As shown in the same plot, for the clustering window 20 seconds- 20 Hertz there is no significant increase for ADI-A, ADI-C, ADI-D, ADI-E and SGC 100, while there is a decrease for NSBH, BNS, ADI-B and SGC 300 waveforms. Therefore the optimal clustering window size has been chosen to be 15 seconds - 15 Hertz. 

Real signals are usually relatively broadband and long, while detector glitches are on average either broadband and short or narrow band and long. To distinguish between the two a pre-factor can be applied.
For these reasons the optimal value of the clustering window has been fixed and a series of pre-factors tested.  
The pre-factors applied fold in broadband, long and energetic, as real signals.
They have been applied to all the likelihoods, both injections and off-source, in order to don’t bias the search. The fully tuned coherent cuts, which are exponential curved cuts, have been used.

Five different pre-factors have been tested by re-running the post-processing part of X-Pipeline for each pre-factor, with the optimal clustering window applied.  The first pre-factor privileges short waveforms over longer ones. The second pre-factor privileges long waveforms so the opposite result is expected. The third pre-factor is a combination of the first two.  The fourth pre-factor.. The last pre-factor is bandwidth multiplied by duration. 

The results from the pre-factor tests have been analysed analogously as for the clustering window. The ratio of the distance, when both pre-factor and clustering window were applied, was evaluated against the un-clustered values for physical waveforms at 50% UL. The opposite ratio was evaluated for SGCs waveforms for hrss at 50%.  The distances were calculated using the same method described for the clustering window study. The increase in sensitivity was taken as the ratio of these distances.  In Figure y is shown the sensitivity increment plotted against the pre-factors applied.  As shown, ‘pre-factor 2’ determined a strong decrease in sensitivity for SGC waveforms. The maximum increase was given by bandwidth multiplied by duration, which is the last pre-factor applied in the study, ‘pre-factor 5’. 

A more detailed study of ‘pre-factor 5’ has been done to avoid any bias. The linear, square-rooted and squared values of ‘pre-factor 5’ have been used to re-run the analysis with the optimal clustering window fixed. The study shows the physical waveforms ratio ‘results with pre-factor applied’ against ‘un-clustered results’ and the SGC waveforms ratio ‘hrss unclustered results’ against ‘results with pre-factor applied’ at 50% efficiency.  In Figure z the increase in sensitivity is shown for the interesting cases (no pre-factor, linear pre-factor, square-root of pre-factor, pre-factor squared; all with clustering window fixed). The results have been found to be consistent with the clustering window study, which suggests that the increase in sensitivity obtained is not due to fluctuations. 


Therefore the optimal clustering window has been confirmed to be 15 seconds-15 Hertz and the best pre-factor has been identified as  ‘bandwidth multiplied by duration’. 
Clustering window and pre-factor have been applied to the results from the following GRBs from O1: E190216, E191188, E198774, E203926, E211350, E215644, EXXXXXX1.
The criteria for the sample spanned from long and short waveforms, good and poor antenna factors and good and poor sky localizations.  

The analysis has been carried through by evaluating the fractional increase in sensitivity. For ADIs this was given by the value of the distance for the clustered data minus the corresponding distance for the un-clustered case, all divided by the latter. For SGCs it was given by the value of the distance for the un-clustered data minus the corresponding distance for the clustered case, all divided by the distance for the un-clustered data.

The detailed values for the fractional increases in sensitivity for 50% UL and 90% UL are shown in Table x for each waveform and for all the GRBs studied.
A statistically significant increase in sensitivity has been achieved for long waveforms, 17% on average for ADIs, while average of 14% for both neutron-star black-hole (NSBH) and binary neutron stars (BNS) signals. For shorter waveforms the average increase in sensitivity was 10%, with no decrease in SGC waveforms, which were not of particular interest for this study.  The minimum and maximum increases for both 50%UL and 90%UL for all waveforms have been registered in Table y. 

The results have been further analysed by studying the fractional increase in sensitivity for the 50% UL in relation to the antenna response, F_+^2 + F_x^2 , and to the sky position error. 
No correlation has been found between the antenna factor for Hanford (H1) and Livingston (L1) detectors, as shown in plot x.  

An inverse proportionality has been found with respect to the sky position error, as shown in plot y.  The fractional increase in sensitivity decreases as the error in the sky location increases. This behaviour has been tested for NSBH, BNS, ADI-C and ADI-E waveforms and resulted consisted for all.


Eventually the loudest dummy on-source events with clustering window and pre-factor applied didn’t show the power-law type of likelihood for any of the GRBs studied. 
Therefore the loudest dummy on-source events for the clustered cases have been plotted against un-clustered corresponding values for all the GRBs , but only for ‘loghbayesian’ likelihood.  The plot is shown in Fugure x but no correlation between the values has been individuated.
